# DSC210_FA24_Group25: Cryptography

## Course: DSC 210: Numerical Linear Algebra

## Instructor: Dr. Tsui-wei Weng

### Instructions: 
* Original environment is via Google Colab with default Python runtime. Results may vary for different runtimes and hardware.
* Ensure the following libraries are installed in python 3 environment:
  * pycryptodome
  * eciespy
  * matplotlib
* Open DSC_210_Code.ipynb and click run all cells (cells must be run in order to prevent errors)
* It should take a few minutes to finish running. Cells for RSA are especially slow, possibly taking up to 60s to complete.

### Results:
See the included PDF file for detailed outputs.
